# Price_predictionByML
Price prediction By machine learning
This machine learning project using python is created to give you a complete understanding of how machine learning problems are tackled in real-world scenarios. 
We will understand the problem of a real estate company from its CEO and then apply ML to solve it.  In this project I will be walking you through analyzing the problem from collecting data, importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values and much more. 
At the end we present the problem to the real estates company who will use the model for predicting house prices given a set of features. Learn through this project how concepts like cross validation, train-test splitting, stratified shuffle split, cross validation and sampling work in action.
